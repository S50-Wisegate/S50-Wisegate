<h1>Applications of YOLO in traffic management</h1>

	<h2>Definition</h2>
	
	</ul><p>YOLO is an algorithm for detecting objects and providing feedback about said detected objects. We are trying to find the potential of improving traffic management with the application of YOLO.</p>

	<h2>Why we chose this topic</h2>
	</ul><p>- This is an intresting use of image detection that could increase the efficiency of our roads.</p>
	</ul><p>- Could lead to fully autonomous traffic management.</p>
	</ul><p>- This could be an important role in the formation of smart cities.</p>
	
	<h2>Importance of YOLO in traffic management</h2>
	</ul><p>- Prevent long commute times and congestion through dynamic traffic lights.</p>
	</ul><p>- Aids in the creation of smart cities.</p>
	</ul><p>- Help save lives by utilising image detection to contact first responders.</p>
