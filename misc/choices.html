<h1>Choices of applying YOLO in traffic management systems</h1>


<p>
YOLO's capabilities may revolutionize traffic management in the area of crime assistance. On the other hand, YOLO being applied in the automated traffic management process may change the social climate and move society in a more harmonious direction, and will even promote economic growth. Nevertheless, the regulatory and information security issues arising from the popularity of YOLO are unprecedented challenges.
<p>

<p>
- Surveillance systems can help police officers increase the speed of solving crimes through YOLO. According to the analysis of the literature written by Menaka k and Yogameena B (2021), firstly, the surveillance video on the road is used as an input source, and after the deblurring process, the video is deconstructed and calculated and output to the face recognition part. And in the face recognition part, YOLO has the highest accuracy rate of 87%, which is 16% higher than the average of the others. The popularity of this technology could lead to a significant reduction in crime on both sides of the street. When people go to commit crimes out of impulse, there will be more restraining forces to check them. And with the addition and spread of facial recognition technology, people's whereabouts will be fully captured, which in turn will eliminate the idea of crime for the less determined bad guys. It is foreseeable that if this technology becomes popular, society will become more stable and harmonious.
<p>

<p>
- The application of YOLO in automated traffic management has predictable socio-economic benefits. Studies by Mohammad et al., (2021) have shown that trained traffic cameras loaded with YOLO can accurately detect 37 vehicles in 7 lanes of traffic without interruption. This is an ability that humans do not possess. For traffic police, attention is often focused only on the front-most vehicles, and congestion in the entire lane cannot be addressed at the root. According to a report written by Jim F (2015), from the Texas Transportation Institute, it is estimated that the U.S. loses $160 billion annually to traffic congestion, including loss of productivity, fuel, vehicle wear and tear, and personal health. And if the data collected by YOLO is shared with route optimization tools, congestion can be minimized. Accurate identification and algorithmic support will not only reduce the amount of time people waste on the road, but will also improve the efficiency of society's functioning by increasing road throughput. Economic losses on the road will be reduced to some extent. In turn, it increases the efficiency of economic output.
<p>

<p>
-YOLO can be used as an image recognition tool to improve society, but it can also be used by unsuspecting people. Among the many illegal incidents, YOLO is most likely to be used for illegal data collection. According to an article written by Marc D (2020), police officers in high-tech crime units have used facial recognition technology to conduct private trials and grab billions of images from social media sites without informing privacy experts and police commissioners, and not only that, they have used the technology for racial profiling. They specifically searched for contractors who appeared to be Maori and Polynesian and Irish roofers simply because they looked like wanted criminals. In turn, officials responded to see if the system had trouble identifying non-Europeans. This racist behavior combined with a high-performance image recognition tool like YOLO could lead to violent conflict and even riots in areas of high racism if not strongly regulated. Although YOLO is not a tipping point, if misused, it can become a trigger for racial conflicts and intensify racial tensions, which is contrary to the original purpose of YOLO applications. Therefore, a strong independent regulatory mechanism should be gradually established in the social trial stage, and only when the system is perfect enough and the guarantee system is complete, can large-scale promotion be put on the agenda.
