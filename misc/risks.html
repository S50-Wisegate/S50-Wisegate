<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<font size="8">
<p>
Applying YOLO in traffic management system brings human opportunities to have a better society, however it is necessary to figure out if there are potential risks and harms. The risks include ransoming organizations applying YOLO by hacking, weaponizing YOLO for warfare or other dark-side usage, data breaches related traffic violations by impersonating, etc. 
</p>

<p>
It is terrifying that if the traffic management system integrated with YOLO is hacked for ransom, the culprits could result in disorder of the transport. It was reported 150,000 surveillance cameras were hacked including those in education organizations, hospitals, and business companies this March (Turton, 2021). When non-benign organizations or individuals release the control of the system to the public or plan to damage or ransom these companies financially, it would be a disaster and cause unpredictable financial loss.
</p>

	
<p>
The websites like <a href="https://www.earthcam.net/">https://www.earthcam.net/</a> and <a href="http://www.insecam.org/">http://www.insecam.org/</a> have authorized public cameras for different usage involving tourism, aviation, museums, etc. However, we cannot ignore the problems when these cameras are controlled by non-benign organizations. Even worse, combining weapon systems with the hacked YOLO systems, people will be in highly unsecure environment and countries will face the worst national security issues than ever. 
</p>	

<p>
Before integrating YOLO to fundamental systems such as traffic management system, the security of the system should be assured. To be more specific, whenever an attack or malware occurs, the system should be capable to defend by itself and works properly during the attacking. This is to prevent from potential risks after implementing YOLO in the traffic management system. There are several ways to protect the system, which include software or hardware firewalls, building high-standard defending system, etc. 
</p>	
	
<p>
Any flaw in the applications can be used to launch an attack. If YOLO is hacked which is integrated into the traffic management system involving thousands and millions of cameras in a country and used in cyberterrorism or cyberwarfare, this will be beyond transport chaos. It is an uncountable expense for fixing the problem. It is pointed out that the camera which plays an important role in sensing objects can be disturbed to lose its function or provide wrong feedback (Greenberg, 2016). It means that YOLO might be easy to stop working when there is some tool disturbing the signal or interrupting objects capturing since YOLO works with cameras, which could be disturbed by signal tools. 
</p>

<p>
As YOLO cooperates with cameras, the videos and photos captured by YOLO could be used in impersonating if the technique is controlled by non-benign organizations or individuals who want to defraud. The identity may be used in blackmailing about the traffic violations in this case. According to the data, there were over 15 million US citizens reported identity theft or fraud in 2016 (Baecker, 2019). The unauthorized access to YOLO could be a potential risk that causes data leaking. This produces privacy issues of society involving most people because YOLO is implemented in the traffic management systems. The leaked photos and videos could be used to defraud in crimes. It is important for transportation organizations applying YOLO to regulate the authorization.  
</p>	
		
<p>
By applying YOLO in traffic management as well as in smart cars, it is possible to leave more time for drivers to react if the technique is highly reliable. However, the recent research indicates that the accuracy of recognizing the traffic signs is close to 98.8% while the frame per second (FPS) only reaches 43.8, which cannot satisfy the requirement of a car running at the normal speed (Zhang et al., 2021). It is to say that integrating YOLO into the whole traffic system including transportation may still be far beyond the capability. Even YOLO becomes reliable enough to connect to the whole traffic system to manage transportation and people’s commuting, when people become aware of the benefits of automatic response to traffic danger, they may ignore the responsibility of focusing on the roads by themselves. Eventually, when people totally rely on this assistant technique, any slight deviation in detection can cause serious accidents. To reduce the risk, people should treat YOLO as accessibility instead of the main function in commuting.
</p>	

<p>
With the development of technologies, the risks are always with advantages and convenience (Baecker, 2019). It is pointed out by Baecker (Baecker, 2019), although automobile provides possibilities that people can live at a place where it is miles away from their workplace, comparing with the society having no vehicles, there is less accident and fatal injury. “IT security flaws are exploited by outsiders for personal or political gain.” [3, page187] This reminds us that even there are potential risks to applying YOLO in the traffic management systems, however, if consider carefully and regulated properly, people could get more benefits and minimize the negative consequences.  
</p>	

<p>
The mature YOLO needs samples to train the algorithm to be perfect (Mider, 2019), however, is it correct to release a flaw system to public for gathering the data which might make the system perfect? Because test data is based on possible accidents and loss of life.
