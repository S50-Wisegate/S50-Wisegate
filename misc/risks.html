<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><pre>
Applying YOLO in traffic management system brings human opportunities to have a better society, however it is necessary to figure out if there are potential risks and harms. The risks include ransoming organizations applying YOLO by hacking, weaponizing YOLO for warfare or other dark-side usage, data breaches related traffic violations by impersonating, etc. 
It is terrifying that if the traffic management system integrated with YOLO is hacked for ransom, the culprits could result in disorder of the transport. It was reported 150,000 surveillance cameras were hacked including those in education organizations, hospitals, and business companies this March [1]. When non-benign organizations or individuals release the control of the system to the public or plan to damage or ransom these companies financially, it would be a disaster and cause unpredictable financial loss.
