<h1>Opportunities of applying YOLO in traffic management systems</h1>

<p>
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real time object detection and classification software which is in development and hasn’t been integrated into many modern-day systems, however it has a wide variety of practical applications that could greatly benefit society. One example of this are the opportunities that arise from implementing YOLO in government-based traffic management.
<p>

</ul><h4><p>
-Increase efficiency and safety of traffic lights
<p></h4>

<p>
An opportunity that comes from applying YOLO in traffic management is the potential for decreasing commute times while increasing the safety of roads using smart traffic control systems. Shinde, et al. (2019) proposed a system which detected the amount of cars in each lane of an intersection and produced a density number based on the amount and type of vehicles detected. The traffic lights would then compare this number from each lane and decide which lane required the right of way to reduce overall congestion. For example if there is a completely empty lane the traffic lights would no longer give a green light priority to these lanes and instead focus priority on the busier lanes. Carnis & Blais (2013) state that the implementation of the French automated speed enforcement program (ASEP) observed a 21% reduction in non-fatal car crashes and a 26% reduction in fatal car crashes. It is logical to conclude that a more comprehensive traffic management and enforcement system could create safer roads for the public. From these examples I conclude that traffic flow and road safety could greatly benefit from the application of YOLO in traffic management systems, furthermore these improvements could potentially aid in the formation of smart cities and in the collection of large traffic data to find more improvements for road systems in the future.
<p>

</ul><h4><p>
-Decrease response time of first responders
<p></h4>

<p>
Another opportunity in the application of YOLO in traffic management systems is the ability to notify emergency services of crashes and accidents almost as quickly as they occur using image detection. Instead of relying on bystanders or victims to call emergencies services. This could improve the response times of first responders greatly reducing the amount of deaths seen by car accidents.
<p>

<p>
Byrne JP, et al. (2019) state in an investigation of the Association Between Emergency Medical Service Response Time and Motor Vehicle Crash Mortality in the United States,
  “The MVC mortality rate was significantly higher in counties with longer response times. In counties with response times of 12 minutes or greater, the mortality rate was 11.9 per 100 000 person-years; counties with response times of less than 7 minutes had a mortality rate of 4.9 per 100 000 person-years…” this supports a strong link between response times of emergency services and survivability of car crashes, further proving the increased safety of the implementation of YOLO in traffic management systems.
<p>

</ul><h4><p>
- Criminal surveillance
<p></h4>

<p>
The final opportunity I will be covering in this discussion is the potential for criminal surveillance and tracking through the application of YOLO in traffic management systems. This could be achieved through adding blacklisted suspects and parolees to a database that checks license plates of cars and pertinent information about their whereabouts and time of sighting. This could greatly reduce the number of parolees and suspects in cases that attempt to escape their sentences.
<p>
	
<p>
In short it is clear that there are a lot of opportunities with the potential to greatly improve modern day society that come with the application of YOLO in traffic management systems. This implementation has a wide scope of improvements ranging from reducing commute times to even lowering the rate of traffic crimes such as speeding or reckless driving further proving the need for greater investment in the research behind object detection software such as YOLO.
